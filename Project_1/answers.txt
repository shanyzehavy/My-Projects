A. If done manually, we should have gone through all the players' list on the website (over 1000 players) 
and click each player with only english letters in his name (25 players total)
for each such player we should have looked for the word "Midfielder" or "midfielder" using ctrl f
Lets try to assume how long that would have taken!
one minute for each search action on each page
times 25 pages
plus the total go-over the entire players' list on the site - about 2 hours

To sum up - abut 2.5 hours total for this kinda manual assignment


B. Using bash scripts makes long procedures shorter and efficient with almost zero effort required from the user
We could use the scripts for many long procedures, large scales fies, etc.... e.g:
Opening a few chosen applications automatically when turning computer ON
Delete the answers out of last years exams
sign to a frontal lecture in the campus, via moodle site
Going over our Downloads directory and delete previous semesters uneccesary files
Creating a script with your own schedule - the script will open the moodle then enter the course-page then the zoom-link for the class righ on time! So youre never latr for your Zoom classes :)

 

C. This could have done automatically by performing pretty much a similar idea, with a few changes:
In order to perform the process every hour we will create a loop, which wil contain at the end of it a delay command for 1 hour, so that the script will perform the search action for the midfieldrs every hour
Idea:
LOOP {
	FORMER SCRIPT
	DELAY COMMAND
}
To avoid multiple accourance of players each time we perform this process we will overide the former results file (using > instead of >>)
